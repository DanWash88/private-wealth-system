      <!-- Lesson 1 -->
      <div class="lesson-card">
        <h2>Lesson 5.1: The Concept of Your Private Bank</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Use life insurance cash value as your personal lending pool.</li>
          <li>Fund an ILIT with whole or indexed universal life insurance.</li>
          <li>Access loans tax-advantaged while maintaining growth.</li>
          <li>Death benefit stays intact and tax-free for heirs.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="exercise">
          <p><strong>Example:</strong> Sarah funds her ILIT with $20,000/year. After 5 years she has $120k cash value, borrows $50k for real estate, repays from rent, and keeps full death benefit.</p>
          <p><strong>Exercise:</strong> Identify one opportunity where a policy loan could replace a bank loan and estimate potential interest saved.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <!-- Lesson 2 -->
      <div class="lesson-card">
        <h2>Lesson 5.2: Leveraging Life Insurance Cash Value for Investments</h2>
        <ul>

          <li>Keep policy growth tax-advantaged while investing externally.</li>
          <li>Document every move for clarity and performance tracking.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="exercise">
          <p><strong>Exercise:</strong> Build a 3-row table of potential investments showing how a policy loan funds each, including growth, repayment schedule, and benefits over traditional loans.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <!-- Lesson 3 -->
      <div class="lesson-card">
        <h2>Lesson 5.3: The Power of Compound Growth Inside Policies</h2>
        <p>Whole and indexed universal life policies compound due to guaranteed growth and dividends.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Growth is tax-deferred and uninterrupted by loans.</li>
          <li>Properly managed loans keep death benefit intact.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="exercise">
          <p><strong>Exercise:</strong> Project your 10-year cash-value growth and calculate the maximum safe loan you could take each year.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <!-- Lesson 4 -->
      <div class="lesson-card">
        <h2>Lesson 5.4: Using Loans Strategically Without Paying Bank Interest</h2>

          <li>Borrow from policy at low interest and reinvest at higher ROI.</li>
          <li>Keep repayment disciplined to maintain compounding growth.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="exercise">
          <p><strong>Example:</strong> Borrow $50k at 5% â†’ invest in property earning 10% = net $2.5k profit while policy still compounds.</p>
          <p><strong>Exercise:</strong> Pick an investment with ROI &gt; 5% and draft a funding/repayment plan using a policy loan.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

          <li>Ensure tax-free wealth transfer and creditor protection.</li>
          <li>Allow trust to manage loans and distributions for heirs.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="exercise">
